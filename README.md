# 1-DOFRocketSim
A 1 direction  of freedom rocket-launch simulation.


Compiler: g++
Languages Used: C++

This project is meant to prepare me for a career in flight systems development. This project will be considered finished when my rocket can reach a desired height smoothly (no overshooting), hover at a specific height, fly to and maintain several heights in a single flight, and land smoothly.

Program should output flight data (height values) to a seperate excel sheet or other modeling software where a smooth graph can be generated without any anomalies

Bonus features after project completion:
-Auto land feature when fuel gets low
-Variable fuel consumption based on current thrust output ( https://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/k-12/airplane/rktthsum.html )
